The design in the F3D file was created by Tom van Thiel, with the exception of the printed circuit board and the parts placed on it. That was copied from the original [BCD-0o27 repo](https://gitlab.com/fschuetz/bcd-0o27/-/tree/main/hardware/BCD-0o27?ref_type=heads) of [Florian Schuetz](https://gitlab.com/fschuetz).
