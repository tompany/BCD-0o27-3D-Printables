# BCD-0o27-3D-Printables

3D printable enclosure for the BCD-0o27-3 created by Florian Schuetz. The original project can be found here: https://gitlab.com/fschuetz/bcd-0o27

This is a 3D printable vintage Nintendo like casing for the BCD-0o27 including a print and assemble guide. Made this for two colleagues who visited the BalCCon2k23.
