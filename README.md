# BCD-0o27-3D-Printables

3D printable enclosure for the BCD-0o27-3 created by Florian Schuetz. The original project can be found here: https://gitlab.com/fschuetz/bcd-0o27

This is a 3D printable vintage Nintendo like casing for the BCD-0o27 including a print and assemble guide. Made this for two colleagues who visited the BalCCon2k23.

## What is in this repository
* The STL printable files are in the ["STL files"](./STL%20files) directory
* The **editable** original Autodesk Fusion 360 design is in the ["F3D files"](./F3D%20files) directory
* A print and assembly manual can be found here: [3D print and Assembly Manual](/3D%20print%20and%20Assembly%20Manual%20.md)

The design in the above-mentioned F3D file was created by Tom van Thiel, with the exception of the printed circuit board and the parts placed on it. That was copied from the original [BCD-0o27 repo](https://gitlab.com/fschuetz/bcd-0o27/-/tree/main/hardware/BCD-0o27?ref_type=heads) of [Florian Schuetz](https://gitlab.com/fschuetz).

If you have any question about the design, please send me a message on Discord: 703155474991939584 (display name: "Tompany")
